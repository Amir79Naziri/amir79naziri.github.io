title: "Exploring Visual Prompt Tuning for Demographic Adaptation in Foundation Models for Medical Imaging"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) enables efficient adaptation of large medical foundation models with minimal resources. Compared to linear probing and full fine-tuning, VPT performs better on imbalanced demographic data, achieving results close to full fine-tuning, especially for underrepresented groups. It offers a resource-efficient alternative when data and computing power are limited.'
