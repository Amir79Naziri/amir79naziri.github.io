title: "A Comprehensive Approach to Misspelling Correction with BERT and Levenshtein Distance"
collection: publications

permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This research addresses spelling errors—common yet impactful issues in written communication—by using neural networks. Specifically, it leverages BERT masked language model, combined with Levenshtein distance, to detect and correct both real-word and non-real-word errors. A comprehensive dataset of categorized mistakes was used with multiple pre-trained BERT models. Results show that this approach outperforms existing Persian-language correction systems in accuracy and effectiveness.'
