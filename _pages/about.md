Machine Learning Engineer with over two years of hands-on experience in designing and optimizing ML models, particularly in NLP, big data, and bioinformatics. I am passionate about advancing machine learning applications in real-world scenarios, especially within healthcare and drug discovery. Proficient in Python, PyTorch, Spark, and TensorFlow, I bring expertise in building scalable solutions, from developing generative AI models for biological data interpretation to deploying NLP-based systems for language processing. Currently pursuing an MSc in Computer Science, focusing on generative AI for drug discovery. Always eager to connect, collaborate, and explore the next frontier in machine learning.
